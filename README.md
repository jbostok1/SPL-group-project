to run put runhaskell LogisticRegression.hs into your terminal

You will be prompted to give data, first will be the temperature you will be comparing against.  All other data will be the data of the day you are comparing against. 

After all data is given the code will run and return the result of either a 1.0 or a 0.0.  a 1.0 indicates the model predicts that the data of the day you gave would predict the temperature would be over the given temperature, a 0.0 would predict it will be bellow the given temperature
